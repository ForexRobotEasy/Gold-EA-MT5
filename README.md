## Product Description

Gold EA MT5 is a high-profit, low-risk Forex tool designed to trade the Gold (XAU/USD) symbol on the MetaTrader 5 platform. The EA is equipped with various features and functionalities to optimize trading performance and minimize risks.

The EA is initialized with input parameters that can be adjusted according to the user's preferences. These parameters include:

- `InitialDeposit`: Initial deposit in USD.
- `InitialLots`: Initial lot size.
- `HiddenStopLoss`: Hidden stop loss in points.
- `MaxDrawdown`: Maximum allowed drawdown percentage.

The expert initialization function (`OnInit()`) checks the account balance and ensures it is sufficient to meet the specified initial deposit. It also sets the initial lot size, hidden stop loss, and maximum drawdown. Additionally, it prints the initial settings for reference.

The expert tick function (`OnTick()`) is responsible for the indicator calculation, grid system, position management, hidden stop loss implementation, position closing at maximum drawdown, position trailing stop, position take profit, position modification, logging, and error handling.

The expert deinitialization function (`OnDeinit()`) handles indicator deinitialization, closing any open positions, logging, and finalizing.
